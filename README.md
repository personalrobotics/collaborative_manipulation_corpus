# Collaborative Manipulation Corpus
A Corpus of Natural Language Instructions for Collaborative Manipulation

# Overview 
This site presents a dataset of natural language instructions for object specification in manipulation scenarios. It is comprised of 1582 individual written instructions which were collected via online crowdsourcing. This dataset is particularly useful for researchers who work in natural language processing, human-robot interaction, and robotic tabletop manipulation. It provides a benchmark of image/instruction pairs to be used in system evaluations as well as uncovers inherent challenges in table-top object specification.
